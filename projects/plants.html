        <h2>Herbarium Specimen Georeferencing</h2>
        
          <P>For the past 250 years, botanists have documented the plants of a region by collecting portions of plants, 
          flattening and drying them, and gluing them to stiff sheets of a paper, 
          along with a label containing textual information such as the name of the plant, 
          when and where it was collected, and by whom.  
          These samples become permanent museum specimens and are stored in repositories called herbaria.  
          There are about 2800 active herbaria in the world, containing about 335 million specimens.  
          Brazil has approximately 125 active herbaria containing about 6,800,000 specimens. 
          There are probably between 1 and 1-5 million herbarium specimens in from Amazonia, 
          distributed among approximately 75 herbaria worldwide.  
          The overwhelming majority of specimens have been made since 1900; 
          specimens collected before that date originate from only about six different exploring expeditions.  
          Probably the single largest collecting effort in the region was the Projeto Flora Amazonica project,  
          1977-1984, which resulted in about 33,000 collections.
		</P>
		<P><BR></P>
		<P>For this project, we will assemble herbarium specimens of plants from throughout Amazonia focusing first on Bignoniaceae and Lecythidaceae, 
		but including specimens from as many other groups as possible.  
		Data from the relevant specimens have already been digitized, 
		e.g., digital images have been captured of the specimens and the label data has been transcribed into an electronic database.  
		In order to be able to plot on a map  the location where each specimen was collected, 
		we will need to have a numerical presentation of that site, i.e., latitude and longitude values.  
		Because many specimens in the dataset for this project were collected before the time when collectors routinely carried geopositioning devices with them in the field,
		the geographic coordinates were not gathered at the time of collection, 
		and must be added retroactively through a process called georeferencing.  
		Georeferencing involves using a variety of tools, including Google Earth, gazetteers, 
		collector’s field books and paper maps to add approximate the location for each collection.
		</P>
		<P><BR></P>
		<h2>Plant phylogeney and phylogeography</h2>	
			
		<P>The Bignoniaceae are
		mainly pantropical with only a few representatives found in temperate
		zones. Tropical America, with ca. 80 genera and 600 species, is the
		center of diversity of the family. Molecular phylogenetic data
		support the monophylly of the family, excluding <I>Paulownia </I>(=
		Paulowniaceae) and <I>Schlegelia</I> (= Schlegeliaceae). The same
		studies suggest that Neotropical tribe Bignoniaceae is also
		monophyletic. This tribe is endemic to the Neotropics, includes all
		the lianas and shrubs with capsules, and consists approximately 350
		species in 50 genera; thus, the plant groups studies with include
		three life forms: trees (Lecythidaceae) and shrubs and lianas
		(Bignoniaceae).</P>
		<P><BR></P>
		<P>Members of the
		Bignoniaceae exhibit various patterns of flowering phenology which,
		together these are hypothesized to allow the maintenance of high
		species diversity by allowing different species to share limited
		pollinator resources. The spectacular flowers of Bignoniaceae  are
		mostly pollinated by bees and wasps but butterflies, hawkmoths, and
		bats are also pollinators. Most of the species of this group are dry
		capsules with winged seeds that are either wind- or water-dispersed
		but a few species have seeds that are ornamented, a feature that
		facilitates adherence and dispersal by animals.
