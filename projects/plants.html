        <P>The plant group will devote most of its phylogenetic effort towards the Bignoniaceae and Lecythidaceae, two key plant families of Amazonian plants.  Our goal is to obtain detailed species-level phylogenies for the whole Lecythidaceae and for the tribe Bignonieae (Bignoniaceae), by employing genomic DNA datasets derived from next generation sequencing.  In parallel, detailed phylogeographic studies will be conducted for selected taxa in order to further understand fine-scale diversification patterns within those groups.  Data derived from the phylogenetic and phylogeographic analyses will be combined with distributional, geological, and environmental data over time in order to test for congruence between the phylogenetic history of these organisms, areas of endemism, and putative geological and climatic drivers of diversification.  The predominance of the tribe Bignonieae (lianas) and Lecythidaceae (trees) in Amazonian forests led these plant families to be chosen for this project; however, others are encouraged to contact us for collaborative studies involving other plant families.

		<h2>Documenting Biodiversity</h2>			
		<P>For the past 250 years, botanists have documented the plants of a region by collecting portions of plants, flattening and drying them, and gluing them to stiff sheets of a paper, along with a label containing textual information such as the name of the plant, when and where it was collected, and by whom.  These samples become permanent museum specimens and are stored in repositories called herbaria.  There are about 2800 active herbaria in the world, containing about 335 million specimens.  Brazil has approximately 125 active herbaria containing about 6,800,000 specimens. There are probably between 1 and 1-5 million herbarium specimens from Amazonia, distributed among approximately 75 herbaria worldwide.  The overwhelming majority of specimens have been made since 1900; specimens collected before that date originate from only about six different exploring expeditions.  Probably the single largest collecting effort in the region was the Projeto Flora Amazonica project, 1977-1984, which resulted in about 33,000 collections. 
		</P>
		<P>For this project, we will assemble herbarium specimens of plants from throughout Amazonia focusing first on our two focal families, Bignoniaceae and Lecythidaceae, but also including specimens from as many other plant groups as possible.  Data from the relevant specimens have already been digitized, e.g., digital images have been captured of the specimens and the label data has been transcribed into an electronic database.  In addition, a numerical presentation of each collection site (i.e., latitude and longitude values) will be obtained so that the exact location where each specimen was collected can be mapped.  Because many specimens in the dataset for this project were collected before the time when collectors routinely carried geopositioning devices with them in the field, the geographic coordinates were not gathered at the time of collection, and must be added retroactively through a process called georeferencing.  Georeferencing involves using a variety of tools, including Google Earth, gazetteers, collector’s field books and paper maps to add the approximate location of each collection.

		<h2>Neotropical Bignoniaceae</h2>

		<P>The Bignoniaceae are mainly pantropical with only a few representatives found in temperate zones. Tropical America, with ca. 80 genera and 600 species, is the center of diversity of the family. Molecular phylogenetic data support the monophylly of the family, excluding<i>Paulownia</i> (= Paulowniaceae) and <i>Schlegelia</i> (= Schlegeliaceae). The same studies suggest that Neotropical tribe Bignonieae is monophyletic. This tribe is endemic to the Neotropics, includes all the lianas and shrubs with capsules, and consists of 393 species in 21 genera. Members of the Bignoniaceae exhibit various patterns of flowering phenology which are hypothesized to allow the maintenance of high species diversity by allowing different species to share limited pollinator resources. The spectacular flowers of Bignoniaceae are mostly pollinated by bees and wasps but butterflies, hawkmoths, and bats are also pollinators. Most of the species of this group are dry capsules with winged seeds that are either wind- or water-dispersed but a few species have seeds that are ornamented, a feature that facilitates adherence and dispersal by animals. 
		</P>
		<P><BR></P>
		
		<h2>Neotropical Lecythidaceae</h2>
		<P>This plant family is distributed in tropical areas throughout the world, but they are especially diverse in the Neotropics. Species of Neotropical Lecythidaceae are among the most spectacular plants in the world because of their showy flowers and large woody fruits. They are ecologically dominant trees in Amazonian forests. Studies by Hans ter Steege and his colleagues have demonstrated that Lecythidaceae are the third most abundant family as calculated from a sample of 277,069 trees from across Amazonia and that <i>Eschweilera</i>, the genus with the most species in Lecythidaceae, is represented by more trees than is any other genus of plants in Amazonia. Lecythidaceae are found as far north as Mexico and as far south as Paraguay.
		</P>
		
		<P>Species of the Lecythidaceae possess numerous flower and fruit features that reflect adaptations for pollination and dispersal. Although all tropical plants have these adaptations, they are especially easy to identify in this family because of the large size of the flowers and fruits and because possible adaptations for pollination by bees, bats, and beetles and dispersal by animals, wind, and water are easily identified.

        </div>
		<P>The Brazil nut (<i>Bertholletia excelsa</i>) is an iconic tree, like the jaguar is for animals, for Amazonian plants. Species of this family are abundant in many parts of Amazonia—reaching their greatest diversity and density in central Amazonia. Trees of this family are indicators of old growth forests, thus, most of the species are not able to survive in degraded habitats. When Lecythidaceae are among the dominants in Amazonian forests it indicates that there has not been major disturbance in those areas for hundreds of years. On the other hand, in many areas if there are no Lecythidaceae present it alerts conservationists that large-scale deforestation, often inflicted by humans, has taken place.
