        <div class="span8 description">
          <p>Understanding how past climate might have influenced organisms in Amazonia is important for several reasons. First, most species have a habitat preference which often includes climate (weather) related variables; so paleoclimate has a direct influence on population dynamics (i.e. expansion or recession of species range limits). Second, palaeoclimate would have had a significant influence on the type of vegetation covering the Amazon Basin, and so organisms that live within or under the forest canopy could have been negatively (positively) affected by forest area changing into grasslands, for example. These organisms could potentially lose most of their preferred habitat, and would have had to migrate or risk becoming extinct.
          </p><p>
          There are several approaches that we can use to reconstruct past climate variables. The most commonly reconstructed climate variables include changes in global temperature, regional changes in precipitation and global changes in atmospheric CO2. The following is a description of some of the methods that we can use to infer Amazonian climate in past geological periods. Reconstructing climate is almost like trying to put together a puzzle as no one method can give you all of the information that you need for any one time period. By using several methods to reconstruct the same variable, we can evaluate how robust our predictions of palaeoclimate (using computer models) are relative to actual palaeoproxy data. Of course, nothing is perfect and debates continue to rise over what the earth today is telling us about the climate of the past.

          <p>Pollen analysis can be used to reconstruct trends in temperature and precipitation.</p>

          <h5>Macrofossils</h5>
          <p>Macrofossils can be used to reconstruct trends in temperature and precipitation.</p>

          <h5>Speleothems</h5>
          <p>Speleothems are good proxies for relative rates of precipitation.
</p>

          <h5>Oxygen and Deuterium Isotopes</h5>
          <p>Stable isotopes of oxygen (O2) and heavy water (deuterium, H2O) can be used to reconstructed changes in temperature and precipitation, respectively.</p>

          <h5>Stable Carbon Isotopes (13C)</h5>
          <p>Stable carbon isotopes can be used to reconstruct relative changes in atmospheric CO2 concentration.</p>

          <h5>Stomatal Density</h5>
          <p>Stomatal density can be used to reconstruct relative changes in atmospheric CO2 concentration.</p>

          <h5>Evaporites (Surface Sediments)</h5>
          <p>An analysis of how surface sediments are deposited can give indications of atmospheric aridity.</p>

          <br/>
          <h4>Computer Modelling</h4>
          <p>Because some of the previous methods of paleoclimate reconstruction cannot cover large spatial scales, researchers can use models of the Earth's climate system to predict palaeoclimate, but to do so, we must at least have an idea of the factors responsible for perturbing the climate in the first place (i.e. called "boundary layer conditions"). A change in atmospheric CO2, for example, will significantly alter global surface temperatures because CO2 is a greenhouse gas and therefore capable of absorbing radiation that would have been normally lost to space. Past geological periods of high CO2 like the Cretaceous are thought to have had warm and moist climates; whereas periods of low atmospheric CO2, like during the last glacial maximum (21,000 years ago, ka), had a climate generally described as colder and drier than today.
          </p><p>
          A computer prediction of paleoclimate is only as good as the information that is put into the model, so in many cases, modelling simulations are used to explore the potential range of climates that may have been experienced in the past. We can alter certain boundary layer conditions such as the position of the continents to look at how palaeogeography can alter global climate. We can simulate South America before and after the creation of the Andes to determine the potential consequences of tectonics for South American weather, and more generally, global paleoclimate patterns. We can explore the consequences of closing ocean gateways (such as the connection of North and South America in the Panamanian region), and/or add (remove) vegetation land cover on the surface of continents.
          </p><p>
          The group of computer models used to simulate modern-day and past climate are called General Circulation Models (GCMs). These models have been continuously developed over the past several decades, with the amount of simulation data and the time taken to conduct such modelling experiments often the limiting factor in conducting climate research. With the advent of super-computers, we are able to use very complicated models of the Earth's climate system and conduct modelling experiments relatively quickly. As we learn more about the Earth's climate system, the models are updated to include these new processes. Fairly recently, GCMs underwent a major revision in that the older models that simulated processes between the atmosphere and oceans now include the biosphere (surface vegetation) that has the ability to feedback (alter) onto climate. These models are known as fully-coupled or Atmosphere-Ocean-Land GCMs.</p>

          <h5>Paleoclimate of Geological Periods of Interest</h5>
          <p>With respect to gaining a better understanding of the factors promoting high biological diversity in Amazonia, paleoclimates of particular periods in geological time should be considered. Generally, paleoclimates of the Mesozoic (250-65 million years ago, Ma) are considered to be warmer and wetter than the paleoclimates of the Cenozoic (65 Ma - present day), although the causes for the cooling and drying of the global atmosphere are still uncertain. Of the periods within the Cenozoic, the Miocene (24-5 Ma), the Pliocene (5-2 Ma), the Pleistocene (2 Ma to 10 ka), and Holocene (past 10 ka) are of critical importance to the biogeographic history of species in Amazonia.</p>
